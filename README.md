This app helps you manage your timesheets by keeping track of your hours for you.

The codebase is a partial fork from a personal project.

Hope it's helpful! :)

# stack

The following technologies were used to create this app:

* Create React App
* React
* Prop Types
* React Router
* Redux
* Moment
* Axios
* Node / Express
* MongoDB (work in progress)
* CSS grid

I also would like to thank my mom and my producer for making this possible.

# dev

This app was created with `create_react_app`. Here are some of the commands that are handy for development:

* `npm install` installs all the dependecies necessary to run the app.
* `npm start` starts the app with hot reload (usually at <localhost:3000>).
* `npm run server` starts the API (debug mode) that is necessary to run the app (at <localhost:5000>).
* `npm run test` gets the tests in `App.test.js` going.
* `npm run build` compiles the app.

# improvements

This app would benefit from the following features:
* proper handling of database queries / get rid of global in the API
* authentication to allow multiple users and securely deploy to the WWW
* export to .csv functionality
* send functionality to submit the timesheet to a predefined email address
* user settings to allow customization of the app
